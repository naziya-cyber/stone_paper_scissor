# Rock Paper Scissors ðŸŽ®

A warm hello from my side!! ðŸ‘‹

Welcome to my  classic game of Rock Paper Scissors. I built this project for fun, to practice my web development skills, and to bring a little bit of joy to anyone who plays it. The game is simple, interactive, and has a touch of styleâ€”just click on your choice and see if you can beat the computer!

## Features
- Play against the computer (it picks randomly!) i use the math object 
- Live score tracking for you and the computer
- Instant feedback on who wins each round


## How to Play
1. Open `index.html` in your browser.
2. Click on Rock, Paper, or Scissors.
3. See if you can outsmart the computer!

## Why I Made This
I wanted to create something thatâ€™s both nostalgic and a little bit competitive. Itâ€™s a small project, but I learned a lot about JavaScript, CSS, and making web pages interactive. Plus, who doesnâ€™t love a quick game of Rock Paper Scissors?

## Credits
All the cradit goes to apna college , it is such a amazing platform from where any one can learn programming  by understanding the topic and concepts with clearity.

Thanks for checking it out. Have fun and may the odds be ever in your favor! âœ¨
